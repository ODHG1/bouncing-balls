# bouncing-balls
This script lets you make the viral Tiktok bouncing balls videos! 
Hello there! 
Welcome to Ballz (haha), anyways, yep, this is the Bouncing balls script.
I made it myself (ODHG1), and if you got this you probably bought it from me on fiverr (https://fiverr.com/odhg1_) or waited until it got put onto Github.
For the melody, just put the notes in order in the melody folder, make sure it starts from 1.wav to the last one, no spaces, 
also if you don't want a melody just make 1.wav the only file (make it the rebound sound you want)
Anyways, i transported a bunch of variables to the config.txt file, so i'll explain most of them here.

ball: If ball = 0, then the ball is made from a color that is the ball_color, else if ball = 1, then it needs an image called ball.png, make sure there aren't edges

ball_size: Pretty self explanatory, 30 is the default

ball_color: Is Only used if ball = 0, and it should be an RGB color as the following: ball_color=172,255,142

gamemode: Gamemode 0 means the ball gets faster everytime it bounces, Gamemode 1 means the ball gets bigger everytime it bounces, gamemode 2 means it gets bigger
and faster everytime it bounces, and gamemode 3 just means it doesn't change at all

ball_speed: Pretty self explanatory as well

trail_mode: You should probably put it on 1 because the 0 one is experimental, try it out you'll understand

trail_cycle_length: the number of pixels that are in the same color in the same pattern, make it 1 for default.

collision_tolerance: Sensibility of the ball towards collision with the edges

music_mode: Put 1 to enable it 

trail_transparency: Alpha factor, just look up HTML Colors with transparency, if you want it to be fully solid put 255

bounce_count: 1 to enable

NOTE: Gamemodes 1 and 2 have been temporarily removed

P.S: If you're having trouble naming the files from 1 to ??, just use advancedrenamer :P

Enjoy and make a bunch of views! Crediting me isn't necessary but if you do, just credit by linking my fiverr. Cheers :D
